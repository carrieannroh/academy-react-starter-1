Create useState variables
first one: array to store the numbers (number array) set to an empty array
    const [variableName, setVariableName] = useState<type goes here>([])
second one: stores the starting number, we're starting from 1
    const [variableName2, setVariableName2] = useState<type goes here>(1)
Create a function that will:
a) increment the starting number by 1 (variableName2 + 1)
b) add the number to empty array, like a history list
    clue: setVariableName([...the array, the number])
- end of that function
Create a new function called fizzBuzzGame
- takes in your array of numbers(the history list) as a parameter : number[]
- will return either : (string or number)[]
- inside the function, declare an empty array, which is gonna store the game results, like: [1, 2, fizz, 4 buzz, whatever]
- now: adding a for loop inside this function
- want to iterate over each number inside your history list
clue: for (const number inside of variableName/history list){
    do the fizz buzz logic
    if number % 3 === 0, push fizz to the empty array you just made
    if number % 5 === 0, push buzz to the empty array you just made
    if none of these just push the number as it is
}
return the empty array you made for the game results
// IN YOUR HTML TAGS
- call the fizzBuzzGame function wherever you wangt the game results to be displayed
- remember that function takes 1 parameter/arugment, so pass in the history list - <p>{fizzBuzzGame(historylist)}</p>
- inside your button that will increase the number, pass that function name <button onClick={thatfunctionname}>next</button>
